# Music-Streaming-System-Assignment-3-
Design and implement a small software system of your choice using a combination of three different design patterns. Your goal is to understand how different design patterns solve common software design problems, and how they can be used effectively in real-world applications.

**Tasks:**
1. **Choose a Software Topic:** <br/>
   Select a small project idea of your choice (e.g., to-do list app, quiz system, inventory manager, game, booking system, etc.).

2. **Apply Three Design Patterns:**

    - Choose **three design patterns** from any category:
    
      - *Creational* (e.g., Factory, Singleton, Builder)
  
      - *Structural* (e.g., Decorator, Adapter, Composite)
  
      - *Behavioral* (e.g., Strategy, Observer, Memento, Chain of Responsibility)
  
    - At least **two patterns must come from different categories.**

3. **Pattern Analysis (for each pattern):**

    - What problem does the pattern solve in your system?
  
    - What is the basic idea behind the pattern?
  
    - How does the pattern work in your implementation?
  
    - What is the main advantage of using this pattern?
  
    - What is the main disadvantage or limitation?

4. **UML Diagram:**<br/>
Create a UML class diagram illustrating how the three patterns fit into your system.

5. **Working Code:**<br/>
Submit working, readable, and well-documented code demonstrating the application of all three patterns.

**Deliverables:**<br/>
- A PDF report addressing the five questions above for each of the three patterns and UML class diagram showing the structure and interactions in your system.

- Complete working source code.
